# Rock Paper Scissors

A JavaScript game where the user plays Rock Paper Scissors against the computer. The first to beat the other in five rounds wins.

Inspired by the [Rock Paper Scissors assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/rock-paper-scissors) as part of the curriculum for the [Foundations Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations) on [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com).
